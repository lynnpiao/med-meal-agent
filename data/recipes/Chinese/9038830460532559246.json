  "instructions": [
    "Oven at 385 degrees.",
    "Make the pesto: In a small food processor add the garlic and almonds. Pulse until finely chopped.",
    "Add the cilantro leaves and about 3-4 Tbsp olive oil, the amount is really a preference of how loose or thick you like the pesto. Start with a little and add a little at a time until you reach the consistency of your preference. Stir in the juice of 1/2 a lime. If you are making this ahead of time...place in a bowl and drizzle just enough olive oil on top to coat, this keeps the air from getting to the cilantro. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.",
    "Saut the peppers with a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over medium high heat for just a couple minutes.",
    "Mix the peppers, corn and black beans in a bowl.",
    "Lay out the egg roll wrappers. Smear some of the cilantro lime pesto on the end closest to you, leaving about an inch of the wrapper on the very end.",
    "Add a spoon full of the veggies along the line of pesto.",
    "Brush the ends of the wrapper with water, this will help seal the egg roll. Fold the end nearest you over the veggies and the two",
    "sides fold in as well.",
    "Roll up the wrapper to the end.",
    "Place seam side down on a lined baking sheet that his been brushed with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.",
    "Brush the egg rolls lightly with olive oil as well, this will help get that golden color.",
    "Bake for approx 18 minutes, or until golden and crispy."
